# What is tokenomics?
## Understanding Tokenomics

Tokenomics is a term derived from the combination of “token” and “economics,” which refers to the economic system and monetary policy of a specific cryptocurrency, token, or NFT. A tokenomics design involves creating a set of rules and incentives that explain the issuance, distribution, and circulation of the tokens within the ecosystem.

Your crypto project’s design tokenomics and economics play a critical role in defining its success in the long run. The main objective of a tokenomics design is to create a sustainable economic model for the tokens, ensure long-term supply, and inform potential investors about how the tokens will be distributed in the market.

A tokenomics framework is an essential element of a crypto project’s whitepaper and litepaper. It provides important information about the token and its economic utility in the project.

Tokenomics has been a critical element of crypto projects since the introduction of Bitcoin’s whitepaper, and it is often baked into the token’s smart contract during the development phase.

Tokenomics includes various aspects such as token demand and supply, utility, and underlying technology. The token supply refers to the total number of tokens that will be created and how they will be distributed among different stakeholders. It is important to distinguish between maximum token supply and circulating supply, as the circulating supply, representing the number of tokens openly circulating in the crypto market, significantly impacts market capitalization and token valuation. Limited supply can drive token demand and price, while excessive supply may lead to price devaluation.

Utility refers to the functionality of the tokens, for example, whether they can be used for transactions within the ecosystem, governance, or staking.

In order for you to build a strong and robust tokenomics model for your web3 project, it's important to know and define all the important elements and how they interact with one another.

Let's look at some of the crucial elements that every good tokenomics design should have:

## Token distribution

This refers to how the tokens will be distributed among different stakeholders, including the founders, investors, and community members. Token allocations are crucial as they ensure a fair distribution of tokens and implementing vesting periods helps maintain credibility and protect investors from fraudulent schemes

## Total supply

## Governance model

The tokenomics design should include a clear governance structure, including mechanisms for community members to propose and vote on changes to the protocol.

## Token economics

The tokenomics design should be designed in such a way as to align the interests of all stakeholders and create a sustainable ecosystem for the long term.


## Token distribution model

How the token will be distributed among different stakeholders like ICOs, IEOs, airdrops, mining, etc.
Token Standards

Defining the token standard that your project will use (such as ERC20, BEP20, and so on) in your token design.
Transaction fees and transfer speed

The tokenomics design should have a low transaction cost and a high transfer speed, which is critical for the ecosystem's health.
